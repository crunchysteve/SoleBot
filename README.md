# Solebot
Solenoid operated, adaptable, robotic drumkit to play real drums from a MIDI drum machine or DAW

I've unpublished the car door lock actuator version because it was latent and not hard hitting enough. 
I'm in the process of prototyping a lighter, simpler moving mechanism using JF-0826B, 12V, 2A, 20N 
solenoids and light weight, 3D printed beater heads. I have two, quick, dirty, minimum voltage test
videos here...

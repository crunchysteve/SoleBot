## Roadmap

1. Now I'm satisfied with solenoids as beater drivers, it's time to knock my repo (and [Thingiverse entry](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6771931) for the project) into shape.
2. Complete a basic Arduino Uno test device with a single beater per instrument running [testTool.ino](https://github.com/crunchysteve/SoleBot/blob/main/code/testTool/testTool.ino)
3. Begin development of a MIDI operated Uno version, still with single beaters.
4. Expand and generalise setup of MIDI control firmware to Mega or Mega Mini board for multiple beaters per instrument and greater nuance. (eg left stick, right stick.)
5. Begin development of a controller and settings memory board using ESP32-2432S028R "Cheap Yellow Display" module and LVGL GUI library.
6. Sit back and feel smug... (If it works) ...then make music!
7. If not burned out by then, develop robotic bass and...
8. ...robotic keys player.
9. Make more music.
